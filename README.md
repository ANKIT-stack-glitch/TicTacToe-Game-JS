# TicTacToe-Game-JS
Welcome to my first project on GitHub! ðŸš€ This simple Tic Tac Toe game is the result of my journey as a beginner in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Explore the world of front-end development with this interactive game, where you can reset the game, play a new round, and witness the excitement of declaring the winner at the end. Join me on my learning adventure and feel free to provide feedback or collaborate. Let's code together!
