# TicTacToe-Game-JS
Welcome to my first GitHub project! 🚀 This simple Tic Tac Toe game is the result of my journey as a beginner in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Explore the world of front-end development with this interactive game 🎮, where you can reset the game ♻️, play a new round 🔄, and witness the excitement of declaring the winner at the end 🏆. Join me on my learning adventure and feel free to provide feedback or collaborate. Let's code together! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
